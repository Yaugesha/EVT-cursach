              Separate from the <strong>module pattern</strong> that we
              discussed in an earlier lesson, “modules” is a feature that
              arrived with ES6. ES6 modules are starting to appear in many code
              bases around the net and getting them up and running will give us
              a chance to explore some new parts of the JavaScript ecosystem, so
              it's going to be a worthy excursion!
            </p>

              Don't be fooled! We're going to cover much more than just the new
              module syntax in this lesson! Before we can really
              <em>use</em> these modules, we're going to have to learn about
              <strong>npm</strong> and <strong>webpack</strong>, which are both
              topics that will be <em>very</em> useful to you even beyond this
              lesson. In the end, the modules themselves are simple to
              implement, so we're going to take this chance to learn about a few
              other things.

                perspective. This article is a bit older, and those who have
                coded along with the example have frequently run into issues, so
                we don't suggest that you code along (you'll be following along
                with the official Webpack documentation later). Nevertheless,
                this article is extremely important conceptually and really

              So far, your projects have had relatively basic file structures.
              As project complexity grows, so too will the benefits of
              well-organized code. A project consisting of a single, long file
              with lots of code can be made easier to navigate and maintain by
              being broken down into multiple smaller files (modules). Further
              benefits of writing code in modules will come below when we
              introduce ES6 modules.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              But there's a problem! The browser would need to make a separate
              HTTP request for each file. The more files you have, the more
              costly this becomes, particularly on slower networks and would
              only increase if you also imported third-party libraries into your
              app.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              What if we had a way to write multiple files and/or import
              multiple third-party libraries but eventually combine them all
              into fewer files at the end so the browser did not have to make so
              many requests?

            <p class="paragraph">
              Enter bundlers. Give a bundler a starting file (an entry point)
              and it will build a dependency graph of the modules and
              dependencies starting from that file, then combine them into a
              single output file. Provide multiple entry points and it will do
              the same for each separately. You can read more about

              Webpack is one such tool for bundling modules. There is a lot of
              talk across the net about how difficult and complex it is to set

              basic enough. In fact, you can see an example of getting it up and

              Let's discuss what's going on there. After installing webpack
              using npm, we set up a project that required an external library

              reasons why this is probably <em>not</em> ideal and then steps
              through using webpack to accomplish the same thing.

                >Let us revisit two key words mentioned earlier -
                <strong>entry</strong> and <strong>output</strong>. In the above
                link's example, we rearranged the files into a
                <code>src</code> and <code>dist</code> folder. Technically, we
                could have called those folders anything, but those names are
                typical. <code>src</code> is our <em>source</em> directory. In
                other words, <code>src</code> is where we write all of the code
                that webpack is going to bundle up for us. When webpack runs, it
                goes through all of our files starting at any entry points we
                give it, looks for any <code>import</code> statements and then
                compiles <em>all</em> of the code we need to run our site into a
                single file per entry point inside of the
                <code>dist</code> folder (short for <em>distribution</em>). In
                this example, we have a single entry point -
                <code>/src/index.js</code>. The <strong>output</strong> file is
                the compiled version - <code>dist/main.js</code>.</span

              Before ES6, there was no straightforward way to handle multiple
              JavaScript files for a single page in a browser. Outside of the

              the Jest tests for the JavaScript exercises back in the
              Foundations course?), you could use something called
              <code>CommonJS modules</code> but that was only for Node and not
              the browser. Fortunately, we now have ES6 modules which work in
              both (although Node still uses CommonJS by default and you need to
              do a tiny bit of tweaking to get it to understand ES6 module
              syntax).
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              Now that we (sorta) understand what webpack is doing, it's time to
              discuss the syntax for ES6 modules (otherwise known as ESM). There
              are only 2 components to it - <strong>import</strong> and
              <strong>export</strong>.

            <p class="paragraph">
              The import statement is the same thing that you used during the
              webpack tutorial so it should be familiar by now.

                >There are <em>many</em> benefits to writing your code in
                modules. One of the most compelling is code reuse. If, for
                instance, you have written some functions that manipulate the
                DOM in a specific way, putting all of those into their own file
                as a ‘module' means that you can copy that file and reuse it
                very easily!</span
              >
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              There are also the same benefits as when using factory functions
              or the module pattern (the module pattern and ES6 modules are not
              the same things; this naming convention is frustrating). With the
              introduction of ES6 Modules, the module pattern (IIFEs) is not
              needed anymore, though you might still encounter them in the wild.
              When using ES6 modules, only what is exported can be accessed in
              other modules by importing. Additionally, any declarations made in
              a module are not automatically added to the global scope. By using
              ES6 modules, you can keep different parts of your code cleanly
              separated, which makes writing and maintaining your code much
              easier and less error-prone. Keep in mind that you can
              <em>definitely</em> export constructors, classes and factory
              functions from your modules.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              To pull it all together, let's write a module and then include it
              in our code. We are going to continue from where the webpack
              tutorial left off. Before beginning, your file directory should
              look something like this:
            </p>
            <pre><code>├── dist
  │&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── main.js
  │&nbsp;&nbsp; └── index.html
  ├── src
  │&nbsp;&nbsp; └── index.js
  ├── package-lock.json
  ├── package.json
  └── webpack.config.js
  </code></pre>
            <p class="paragraph">
              In addition, you should be able to bundle and run webpack by
              typing
              <code>npx webpack</code> in the terminal, (or
              <code>npm run build</code> if you're using the example project

              JavaScript is a programming language that allows web pages to be
              dynamic. It is an interpreted language, which means that it
              doesn't need to be compiled: instead the interpreter (such as a
              web browser) will parse the code and turn it into code that their
              machine can run - suitable for creating dynamic websites that can
              run on any browser!
            </p>

              JavaScript is not only used in the browser. JavaScript runtimes,

              Starting with the 6th edition (commonly known as ES2015 or ES6) in
              2015, a new edition of the standard will be released each year.
              The 6th edition was a major update that brought many enhancements
              over ES5, including notably template strings, expressive arrow
              function syntax, and cleaner syntax for defining classes.

                  The course was very well made. All concepts were explained
                  very clearly and I really appreciate lot of examples and
                  interactive elements. The pace of the course was slower which
                  is ideal for beginners. I recommend to everyone who wants to
